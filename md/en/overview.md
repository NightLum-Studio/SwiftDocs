# Welcome to SwiftDocs

SwiftDocs is a lightweight and fast way to write documentation, combining the power of YAML and the convenience of Markdown.  
With it, you can create clean and structured pages without unnecessary hassle with HTML and CSS.

### Why SwiftDocs?
- Minimum setup, maximum flexibility.
- Simple syntax based on `.md` and `.yaml`.
- Suitable for GitHub Pages and other static hosts.
## About Us
This template was created by **NightLum Studio**.  
Our philosophy is simple: we create worlds where you can dream, build, and explore.  
Boundaries exist only to be overcome — with us, you can bring your ideas to life.

Although the studio was born as a gaming studio, we also develop tools that save time and help focus on what matters most — content. SwiftDocs is one such tool.
